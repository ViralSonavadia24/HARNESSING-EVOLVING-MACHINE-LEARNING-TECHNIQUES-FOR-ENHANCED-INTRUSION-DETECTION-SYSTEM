This project focused on leveraging advanced machine learning (ML) techniques to improve intrusion detection systems (IDS). I evaluated models like K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forest to identify effective methods for detecting network intrusions.

Key outcomes included:

Comparative analysis of ML-based IDS versus traditional signature-based systems.
Insights from case studies to guide best practices in ML implementation.
Strategies to address data privacy concerns.
Using Python for analysis and model development, this project aims to enhance detection accuracy while reducing false positives, contributing to stronger cybersecurity defenses against evolving threats.
